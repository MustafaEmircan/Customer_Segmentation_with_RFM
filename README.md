# Customer Segmentation with RFM 📊

## Business Problem 🎯

FLO aims to segment its customers and develop targeted marketing strategies based on these segments. To achieve this, customer behaviors will be defined, and groups will be created based on these behavioral clusters. By leveraging RFM analysis, we can gain insights into customer preferences and spending habits. 🚀

## Dataset Story 📅
